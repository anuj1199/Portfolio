	<h1 style="text-align:center">Data Visualization</h1><br>
	<p style="font-size:x-large; color:#006666;">Visualizing data structure is one of the hardest job student and many others can face. Study examines that student found difficulties in understanding the basic data structures. As the data structure and algorithm concepts are very wide and one of the major pillars of computer science students for their bright future.
Therefore it is important for instructor so that he can be able to visualize the working of how searching is happening and which sorting consumes less time. These problems can only be understandable if students can visualize it properly. That's why our application comes forward.
As smartphones have become a necessity in this decade, we have developed a data structure visualization application which as of now, there isn't any application available in the market. As available visualization applications are only web supported, we are processing it for smartphone supported.
The interface will be improved to make the experience  of user better. The animation in our app will help the user to understand the concept of the data-structure.
Since it’s an android application, the user will easily access it anywhere and at any time.
It provides an interactive way of learning concepts.

	<h1 style="text-align:center">Plethora Of Knowledge</h1><br>
	<p style="font-size:x-large; color:#006666;">Most of the students are willing to give their time to study but some of them have lack of resources ,which is an obstacle in their learning path and also they want the sources which can provide them free education as most of them are not in a condition to pay much for online material.   Parents are also worried about their children’s future .This is the golden opportunity for the students go study and get ahead in the race. Utilizing the time that the students save while learning at home , they can use this time to upskill themselves in various fields. Digital education can be accessible on clicks and to make that happen for free. Almost everyone who is keen to study will obviously be waiting for a platform like this to be made accessible soon. So we thought of something that can be done in order to cope up with this problem and what can be an easy solution to the problem that many of the learners are facing. The basic idea is to provide a free platform to learners who are keen to learn and provide them the resources that they need. Our platform will provide them with the resources so as to ease their problem, study and focus on their goal even in this time of the global pandemic. We will be providing them with the E-books , NCERTs, course study material, paper banks, competitive competition notes , board paper solutions and various other materials that can be easily downloaded by them whenever they need it. They can choose whatever books they wants, that they can find very easily on our platform free of cost. </p>
